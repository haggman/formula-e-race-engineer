"""Assemble the self-contained Agent Engine deployment folder (chunk 12;
P1.6 fix: agent_pkg excluded from staging, stale check matches imports only).

Why this exists: `adk deploy agent_engine` stages ONLY the folder you point
it at (source_packages = [that folder] — set unconditionally, no extra-
packages mechanism in this CLI generation). Our agent imports two top-level
repo packages (`solution.race_engineer.*`, `shared.*`) that would not exist
on the engine. So we build `build/engine_app/`:

    engine_app/
      __init__.py
      agent.py            <- sys.path bootstrap + re-exports root_agent
                             (the CLI's generated app does `from .agent
                             import root_agent`, so this name is required)
      race_engineer/      <- vendored copy of solution/race_engineer/, with
                             imports rewritten solution.race_engineer -> race_engineer
                             (renamed to avoid colliding with agent.py above)
      shared/             <- vendored verbatim (no clash, no rewrite),
                             EXCEPT agent_pkg.py: the starter/solution seam
                             is a CLIENT-side concept (frontend + dev
                             scripts choose a package); the engine IS the
                             solution agent and never imports it. Staging it
                             would ship dead code whose docstring/env-default
                             legitimately mention "solution.race_engineer".
      requirements.txt    <- engine runtime deps (CLI appends its own too)
      .env                <- engine env: Vertex mode, model location, TOOLBOX_URL

Run from the repo root:  python3 deploy/build_engine_app.py
Idempotent: wipes and rebuilds build/engine_app each time.
DEPLOY_AGENT_PACKAGE picks the source package (default
solution.race_engineer; bonus: starter.race_engineer ships a team's own
agent). Deliberately its OWN knob — NOT activate.sh's AGENT_PACKAGE,
whose starter default would footgun instructor deploys.
